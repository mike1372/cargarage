NOTES ON QUESTIONS, TO DO AND EXTENDED FUNCTIONALITY
====================================================

QUESTIONS
---------
Ask about how to add test data again

TO DO
-----
Add a set of photos for garages for users to select
User deletion: add a separate page to confirm
Change showall to index
Show primary car pictures on show garages page (smaller size)
Clean and DRY up code and add comments where needed
Add content to the About page
Add some content to the home page when logged out
Style page headings

ISSUES
------
Border not working properly for car primary picture
Add picture (from file) buttons are to the left
Moving cars in and out of garages - some logic for handling "no cars" not working properly
Sign in errors - an extra array appears, need to get rid of it

EXTENSIONS
----------
A user should be able to search for a car or garage by various criteria
Add a forgot password (accessible whilst logged out - show on the login page) link that emails the user a link to reset their password
Add garage pictures to allow users to customise their garages

Note raise params.inspect
