Ask about how to add test data again
Getting the correct data out of the join when adding cars to a garage?

TO DO
-----
Add a set of photos for garages for users to select
Prevent a car being moved into a garage that is already there
Need to find out how to DRY up the forms again - see the cookbok example
Add flash errors when users get login details wrong or fail to fill out all form details
User deletion: add a separate page to confirm
Change showall to index

NOTE - PROJECT SPEC NEEDS THE FOLLOWING:
Use an API
Handle invalid data
Get README done in markdown
Correct documentation - add a Resources section
Go through code and comment/clean up where needed

ISSUES
------
People can add an account with a blank username - is there proper error checking on this feature?
Misspelled transmission but since all references to this column are also misspelled it still works
Get the :notices working

EXTENSIONS

A user should be able to search for a car or garage by various criteria
A user should be able to leave comments about cars
Add a forgot password (accessible whilst logged out - show on the login page) link that emails the user a link to reset their password
Add a model for adding many pictures for cars (one-many relationship between a car and its pictures)
Add garage pictures to allow users to customise thier garages

Excerpt from the project spec:
README.md
Projects need a readme file in markdown explaining their project. Explain your concept and data model. What problem are you solving? What gems and/or APIs are you using?
This needs a how and why of what they wanted to solve, how they built, problems, tech used.
This file should include the elements of your project plan.
Add your list of resources, research, and documentation links to this file.
If you're including a separate file or folder for your data model, put it in a file or folder called data_model with the proper extensions.
If you're including a separate file or folder for your wireframes, put it in a file or folder called wireframe with the proper extensions.
