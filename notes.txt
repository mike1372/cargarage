NOTES ON QUESTIONS, TO DO AND EXTENDED FUNCTIONALITY
====================================================

QUESTIONS
---------
How to add photos and not just links to photos on the web?

TO DO
-----
Photos - need to know how to add these, then show all cars by their primary photo
Add a set of photos for garages for users to select
Prevent a car being moved into a garage that is already there
Allow the user to be able to change their password
Need to find out how to DRY up the forms again - see the cookbok example
Add flash errors when users get login details wrong or fail to fill out all form details
User deletion: add a separate page to confirm

ISSUES
------
People can add an account with a blank username - is there proper error checking on this feature?
Forgot to add a car name column to the car table
Misspelled transmission but since all references to this column are also misspelled it still works
Get the notices working

EXTENSIONS
----------
A user should be able to search for a car or garage by various criteria
A user shoule be able to leave comments about cars
Add a forgot password (accessible whilst logged out - show on the login page) link that emails the user a link to reset their password
