Excerpt from the project spec:
README.md
Projects need a readme file in markdown explaining their project. Explain your concept and data model. What problem are you solving? What gems and/or APIs are you using?
This needs a how and why of what they wanted to solve, how they built, problems, tech used.
This file should include the elements of your project plan.
Add your list of resources, research, and documentation links to this file.
If you're including a separate file or folder for your data model, put it in a file or folder called data_model with the proper extensions.
If you're including a separate file or folder for your wireframes, put it in a file or folder called wireframe with the proper extensions.
